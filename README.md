# NexaCore Blockchain

NexaCore is a next-generation blockchain platform with AI integration, sharding, and zk-SNARKs.

## Features

### Hybrid Scalability
- **Sharding + Layer 0 Approach**: Dynamically splits the network while optimizing communication between different chains at the foundation layer.
- **Target Performance**: 100,000+ transactions per second.

### Modular Design
- Customizable functionality for finance, gaming, data storage, and more.

### Zero-Knowledge Privacy
- Built-in zk-SNARKs for transaction privacy while maintaining verifiability.

### AI-Driven Optimization
- Real-time load balancing AI optimizes fees and transaction routing.

### Self-Upgrade Capability
- Protocol updates without requiring hard forks.

## Consensus Algorithm: Adaptive Proof of Contribution (APoC)

APoC combines the benefits of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) while adding a contribution metric:

- **Stake Amount**: Economic commitment to the network (PoS element)
- **Computational Contribution**: Resource provision (PoW element)
- **Network Contribution Score**: Rewards for transaction validation, bug reporting, open-source contributions, etc.

This approach maintains the energy efficiency of PoS while preserving the security of PoW and preventing centralization through the contribution score.

## Unique Features

### AI and Blockchain Fusion
- AI assists with transaction routing and smart contract debugging.

### Dynamic Governance Model
- Voting rights depend on stake amount + contribution score.
- AI analyzes voting patterns to prevent fraudulent voting.

### Developer Templates
- "Plug and Play" modules for easy DApp development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.60+
- Node.js 16+
- RocksDB

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/enablerdao/NexaCore.git
cd NexaCore

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the node
./target/release/nexacore
```

### Running a Node
